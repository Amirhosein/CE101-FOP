It's a repository for my Fundamentals of Programming Course @ Uni.

# How to run:
At first make sure that `gcc` is installed and configured in your system environment PATH. Then follow these commands:

`gcc ./main.c`

In Windows: `./a.exe`
In Unix-based OS: `./a.out`

**Note**: Some commands like sleep and System("cls") is specially for Windows, if you are using a Unix-based OS, make sure to fix these commands before run for better experience.
